# README


Initial readme for this shiny app.

## To get started w/in RStudio
New Project -> Version Control -> Git -> putting in that Repository URL.
You can then open the app.R or app_variable_explorer.R file w/in Rstudio and hit the Run App button to test-drive it

## Get git
Git is a lot to take in, but this is an RStudio-specific workflow for getting set up. It's worth a read, and - at some point - work through Installation and Connecting Git, GitHub, RStudio sections. That will at least get you set up to collaborate through github
